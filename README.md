# Tagging Tracker

The Graffiti Abatement Tracking Tool will provide the infrastructure for a pilot project to remove graffiti.
It is an initiative started by the Community Resource Team (CRT).

In 2015, the CRT developed out of a 3-year U.S. Department of Justice 
[Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation (BCJI) grant](https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=70) and 
is a cross-sector collaboration of community leaders, social services providers, government institutions and law enforcement 
that jointly identify and address community safety issues in the Prospect Avenue corridor.
